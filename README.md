The emulator should work hosted on the website above but if you need to compile the code, ensure you have Angular installed along with the appropriate node modules using NPM. A guide to this can be found at https://angular.io/guide/npm-packages.

The source code for the emulator can be found at /deuce/src/app/. From there, the bulk of the emulator logic can be found within the /panel/ directory. The code can also be found online at https://github.com/gerardward3/level4-project.
